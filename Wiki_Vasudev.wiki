Week 1 - Read the theory aspect behind the project: Random Early Detection (RED), Gentle Random Early Detection (GRED). 

RED:- https://sites.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/tail-drop-vs-red/plan-of-work/red-algorithm 
GRED:- https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8bbe/bb4c3b8b2316cf48c2e95fe5c15e176a56df.pdf (Performance Investigations of Some Active Queue Management Techniques Using Simulation) 

Week 2 - Read about DPDK and it's applications. Also went through Active Queue Management and difference between this and Passive Queue Management.

AQM:- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_queue_management 
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1024256/
Difference between AQM and PQM:-

Week 4 - Tried running QoS Scheduler Sample Application. Got Error. Found out it is due to non availability of cores in system.

Week 5 - Converted RED to GRED by modifying code at lib/librte_sched/rte_red.c and lib/librte_sched/rte_red.h
